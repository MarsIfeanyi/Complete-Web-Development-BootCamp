    Block Elements takes up the whole width of the web page, thus is blocking any other element from being on the same line next to it, on the right on the left.
    Hint: We can use the display property and change block element to inline and vice versa

    <Span> helps us to select some part of text that we want to style differently.
        Span is an inline display element

        COMMON INLINE ELEMENTS

        1. Spans
        2. Images
        3. Anchors

   Hint: You can't actually change the width of inline elements 
   
   INLINE-ELEMENT: With display: inline-block, you can change the width and also make the contents to be on the same line.    

   Display:None, gets rid of our element. Thus we can use this property to hide and show something on our website or for quiz
