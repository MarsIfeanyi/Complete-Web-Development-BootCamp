<!-- 

    Absolute Position: We are positioning the HTML Element relative to its parent.

    Hint: Absolute positioning affects the flow of the HTML Document/element unlike in Relative positioning.

    You can use containers(divs) to fine tune the position of your elements on screen by using a combination of absolute and relative positioning.

    Hint: Position:Fixed; is very useful when you have nav bar or other menus you want to be fixed as users scroll through your website. or a sidebar you want to stay fixed.
