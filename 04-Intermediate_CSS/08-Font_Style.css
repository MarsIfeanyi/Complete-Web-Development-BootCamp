/*  
One of the most important decision you will have to make when you are designing your website is the type of fonts you are going to choose/use.

And a lot of web designers will start off by figuring out a color palette as well as a font scheme.

There are two major font families:

1. Serif fonts
2. Sans-serif fonts
Hint: By default we have the serif font.

For web safe font: cssfontstack.com

Hint: To ensure that everybody has the same viewing experience with regards to the fonts on your website that you will use 'Font Embedding'...

Font Embedding: fonts.google.com.

How to Embed the fonts: After selecting all the fonts you want then copy the link and paste in the head section of your index.html...hint: The link here will then help to specify a location where if users don't have these fonts already installed or cached on their system, then the browser will take them to this location and grab those fonts for them.
