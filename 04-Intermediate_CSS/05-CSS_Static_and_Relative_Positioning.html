<!-- 
HTML Default Rules

1. Content is Everything: Content is the first thing that determines how large things gets displayed and what the height and width will be. This is despite CSS.

2. Order Comes from your code: The other of your HTML elements comes from your code

3. Children sit on parents

WAYS OF CHANGING POSITION PROPERTY

1. Static: All HTML Elements are static in their position by default. ie they go along with the html rules and keep to the default HTML flow.

2. Relative: This allows us to position the element we select relative to how it would have been positioned had it been static.
Hint: When you move an element that have relative position, it doesn't affect the position of anything else on screen
