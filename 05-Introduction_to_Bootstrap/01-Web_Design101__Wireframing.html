    When designing a website the first thing that you need to do before writing codes is to wire-frame.

    Wire-frames are a low fidelity representation of your design. Thus is meant to be done with pencil, a piece of paper and its meant to be really quick.

    Mockup is a high fidelity representation of your app or your web site's design. Mock up is the exact representation of how your site will look.
    
    Hint: The classic workflow is to start off by looking at other people's web sites, which will give you a good idea about the layout and structure, and then looking at some UI patterns by going to website like ui-patterns.com and looking at their design patterns and you think about the problems that you you are actually trying to solve as you're designing your website.
