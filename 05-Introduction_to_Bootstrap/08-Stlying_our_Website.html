    Hint: When designing websites or apps or whatever it may be, try to minimize the number of lines, that you can align things to, because it will usually make your designs look more together.

    Always use the 'Chrome Pesticide' to look out for alignment.

    Hint: Whenever you are deigning web sites you want to think about what is the first thing you want the user to look at. You want to establish some sort of visual hierarchy and you can do that using  ' fontsize' or font weight or highlighting or outlining a whole bunch of things
