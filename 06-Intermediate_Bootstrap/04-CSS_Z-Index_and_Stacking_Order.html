<!-- 
   Hint: Children sit on top of their parent.

   if the divs are at the same hierarchical level, all the HTML elements have a natural stacking order. So that means that whatever comes first in the HTML code, so closer to the top of the file will be closer to the back and then as we go down the HTML file, every other element becomes stacked on top of the previous elements.

   Z-index is a property that we use to change the stacking order by using css.

   Hint: Z-index only works if your elements are positioned (Relative or Absolute), ie when you have an element that is not positioned (when you haven't set the position to absolute or relative or fixed), then the z-index does not apply.

   position: static is the same as no position is defined.

   Hint: All the elements by default have z-index of zero.

   Hint: inorder to change the Z-index of the title image and make it appear below the features sections, then we need to change the color of the background to white, so that the color blends perfectly 

   position:absolute takes an HTML element out of the flow of the document.

   position:relative keeps the element in the HTML flow.

   Hint: Positioned element that comes later in the HTML flow are on top even if they don't have a z-index. Thus in the styles.css we can remove the z-index and still have the features section on top of the title image, because the feacture section has a position that comes after the poition of the title image.
