    REASONS FOR CODE REFACTORING

    1. Readability: Make sure that your code is easy to understand but not just yourself but maybe say  your future self. When you come back in a year to try and understand your code, can you quickly understand what's going on? is everything organized in a logical way? Is everything commented so that you can easily understand what each pert of the code isd about?... Try to keep your code READABLE

    2. Modularity: This relates to how easy is it to reuse bits of your code and how easy is it to narrow down. say if one particular part of your web site breaks down, is your code modular enought that you would be able to anrrow down on the exact section of code or code file that's responsible for the problems that's occuring

    3. Efficiency: How fast does your code run. There are ways of making your code very efficient and very fast. Alot of this happens at the choosing the programming language level
    4. Length

    Hint: At Everypoint in time make sure you're not repeating yourself in your code so that you keep your code really well structured and Readable
