/* 
How to Prevent creating conflicting css rule

1. Use IDs very very sparingly. Don't try to use ids when you can use a class. If possible use ids for only sections and part of ypour code that definitely needs an id.

2. When applying classes to your elements use only one class.

3. Avoid inline styles at all cost
