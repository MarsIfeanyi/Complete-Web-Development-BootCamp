    User Experience is meant to be invisible.
    If you have a good experience with a website it's meant to be unobtrusive and it just lets you do your thing and it feels like as if everything is easy and everything is effortless

TO ACHIEVE A GREAT UX we have to think of 5 things.

1. SIMPLICITY: Keeping things simple is always better than making it more complex or more cluttered.

2. CONSISTENCY: Keep your designs consistent but also keep the functionality of your product consistent. Inconsistency in your design will make a User to be confused when they go from one part of the website to another (having to re-learn how to use your website)

3. READING PATTERNS: Take into account people reading patterns. One of the most common reading pattern is the F-Pattern.
You can design by using the F-layout by having the most important parts (bullet points or pictures or icons, buttons etc) of your content on the left gutter, have the logo at the top and have everything follow this pattern.

Another common reading pattern is the Z-pattern(Where our eyes go from left to right and then zigzagging down all the way the website ). This pattern is pretty famously used in the facebook website.

Hint: When designing your website have a think about how people naturally looks at the page and then place your content in that pattern to make it easier for people who are using your website.

4. ALL PLATFORM DESIGN: Think in terms of mobile responsiveness when designing your website. Always think about how you are using the available spaces and make sure that your website rearranges itself when it's being rendered on a portrait similar screen vs a larger desktop screen.

Hint: You can give your design to professional testers, friends or family to use/test and give your feedback and then improve on the design

5. DON'T USE YOUR POWERS FOR EVIL: Some designers though use the knowledge they have about human psychology and UI and UX to do bad things. And in the design world we call these dark patterns. so patterns which get a user to perform an action or behavior that is beneficial to the company or the designer but it is not necessary what the user wants. And this is another form of bad UX.

Hint: A good design  is helping people do what they want to do and giving them a good experience while they are at it.
