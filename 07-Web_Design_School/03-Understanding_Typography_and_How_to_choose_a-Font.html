    Hint: When you are choosing a serif font family you are making your design look more serious, more authoritative and also a bit older as well. Its is really good if you are designing something like a letterhead for a legal company or a magazine for architectural design. 

    Fonts also have mood. The serif family generally come across as traditional, stable, respectable, authoritative... THese are the words that get thrown around by designers when they are thinking about the serif typeface.

    The Sans-serif Family have a perfect right angle at their feet and this right angle makes them look much more friendly, more approachable, more novel and more contemporary. You will tend to get words like Sensible, simple, straightforward and this is why alot of start ups love using the sans-serif typeface in their websites.

    Hint: You will tend to see designers going for the sans-serifs if they want to write body text which needs to be more legible and more readable.


    Humanist typeface and all of the fonts that belong in that category like Gill sans, Tahoma, Verdana atc are highly readable and highly legible fonts which you can use in the  body types.

    Hint: Readability and Legibility when you are choosing fonts is incredibly important. And the things that you are looking for in the letters when you are looking for legibility are:
    1. Open shapes
    2. Ample inter-character spacing
    3. Un-ambiguous forms
    4. Varying proportions.

    Hint:Stick with just two fonts in one design (Recommended) and when you are combining fonts find fonts that have similar moods and time era to each other.
    Things you want to contrast are the serif-ness for Example you want the head to be serif and body to be sans-serif or the opposite way round. it just create more interest in your design.
    Similarly you can also create interest by changing up the weights between the heading and the body . So making the heading really bold or even using a black typeface and making the body text using something like thin or regular or light. These different weight can create contrast in your design.

    Hint: The next time you are designing a website think about what typefaces you are going to choose. think about what are are trying to convey with those typefaces and then pick a font from the san-serif or serif family or maybe try to combine them.
