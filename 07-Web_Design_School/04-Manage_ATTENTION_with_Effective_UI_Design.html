    Ways to Establish Hierarchy when Designing

    1. Using Colors: This is the most obvious way of establishing Hierarchy. So colors that really pop and stand out have contrast with that background tend to be used for high hierarchy.

    2. Size: The bigger items often draws your eyes to them

    3. Layout: 

    Hint: In terms of UI Design there is an optimal line length. if it is too long it gets a little bit tedious to read but too short it gets a bit too choppy and it is a bit awkward to read. So can aim for 40 to 60 character per line so that it feels comfortable to the user and they will be able to get through the information and still be interested in your website.

    3. Alignment: This has to do with how you position each of the elements on the screen relative to each other.
    Hint: One of the easiest ways of making any sort of design you create look professional is just to reduce the number of alignment points... Take a look at all the things that are on the design and identify a line which goes through the beginning of each item and if you can reduce the number of lines then your design will look a lot more coherent and professional.

    4. White Space: This is a really important concept in all design. white space is the empty space that is around text or around you elements. Thus by adding white space around each element on the screen, you can make your design a lot more minimalist and at the same time elevate it.

    5. Audience: This is probably the most important of all. 
    "Design for your Audience"... Think in terms of your Audience(Children, Adults etc) when you are designing. Think about what would appeal to them and what is important to convey to them.

    Hint: When you are designing websites, Design it for your Audience.
    Have the flexibility in your design so that you are not just creating one style all the time. The flexibility in your design skills is really important when it comes to User Interface design

    Hint: Keep in mind this things: Hierarchy, Layout, Alignment, White space and your Audience and you will be well on the way to creating more beautiful UI for your websites.
