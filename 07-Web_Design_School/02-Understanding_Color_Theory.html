    COLOR THEORY is the art and science of creating the right palette for your website.

    Hint: When you are picking colors you have to be aware of the mood of your color palette.
    
    MOODS OF COLOR

    RED = Love, Energy, Intensity
    GREEN = Freshness, Safety, Growth
    BLUE = Stability, Trust, Serenity
    YELLOW = Joy, Intellect, Attention
    PURPLE = Royalty, Wealth, Feminity

    The predominant color that is going to bve in your design really tells a story and it conveys a message to the user.

    Hint: When you are creating a logo or when you are creating some sort of headline, then yellow is a great choice (Because it grabs attention. But when you are creating something that is designed to be looked at for a long period of time, then yellow can be too attention grabbing. it might actually hurt your user's eyes

If you have a company that has anything to do with food, then Green color is usually a safe bet to go with.

Look at all the financial companies like paypal or the crypto companies like Coinbase they choose Blue color because they want you to know that they are not going to run away with your money (TRust).

Hint: Always make a conscious decision when you are choosing a color palette, is not just whichever color you like or your favorite color, but its actually  "What message am i trying to the user" and then picking an appropriate color.

Combining Colors is the most scientific part of the color theory.
DEsigners will rely on scientific ways of combining colors by taking two colors that are right next to each other on the color wheel and thus creates an Analogous Color palette. And this designs look harmonious and they really work well together.

Hint: The Analogous color palette can be really good for things like the navigation bars and the body of your website or things like a logo and its background  but it is not so good at standing out. Thus if you really want your design to pop, you better take 2 colors from opposite ends of the color wheels by creating COMPLEMENTARY COLOR palette. Complementary color palette really creates that pop.

Hint: You shouldn't use Complementary colors to style text and text background, instead keep/ use it for things like logos or icons or things that you really want to stand out from each other.

Another you can combine colors is by drawing an equilateral triangle to create a TRIADIC Color palette or drawing a perfect square. You can use the Adobe color wheels to create perfect square colors (https://color.adobe.com/create)
